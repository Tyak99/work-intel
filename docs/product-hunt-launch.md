# Product Hunt Launch Playbook

## Work Intel: AI-Powered Weekly Engineering Team Reports

This is the complete step-by-step launch plan for Work Intel on Product Hunt. Follow it in order.

---

## 6 Weeks Before Launch: Community Building

### Week 1-2: Establish PH Presence

- [ ] Create a Product Hunt account (if not already done) and complete your maker profile
  - Use a real photo, link your Twitter/X, write a genuine bio about being a developer/founder
  - The maker profile matters — PH community trusts real people over faceless startups
- [ ] Create the "Coming Soon" page on Product Hunt
  - **Tagline for Coming Soon page**: "See what your engineering team actually shipped this week"
  - **Description**: "Work Intel connects to your GitHub org and generates AI-powered weekly reports — PRs merged, stuck code reviews, team velocity. One admin connects, the whole team gets value. No more Monday morning status meetings."
  - Add your logo and a teaser screenshot of the team dashboard
  - Enable the "Notify me" email collection

### Week 2-6: Engage Daily

- [ ] Follow 50+ makers in the developer tools / SaaS / productivity categories
- [ ] Upvote and leave **genuine, thoughtful** comments on 3-5 products daily
  - Focus on dev tools, team collaboration, GitHub integrations, engineering management tools
  - Comments should be specific: "I manage a team of 8 and we'd use this for X" — not "Great product!"
  - This builds your profile history so you look like a real community member, not a drive-by launcher
- [ ] Engage on Twitter/X with engineering managers and team leads
  - Share pain points about status meetings, visibility into team output
  - Don't pitch Work Intel yet — just build genuine relationships
- [ ] Collect emails: share the Coming Soon link in relevant communities

### Target: 200+ "Notify Me" subscribers before launch day

## 2 Weeks Before Launch: Asset Preparation

### Tagline Options (max 60 chars)

Pick one. All three tested well with the target audience:

1. **"See what your engineering team shipped this week"** (51 chars) — direct, clear
2. **"AI weekly reports for engineering teams, from GitHub"** (52 chars) — mentions AI and GitHub
3. **"Stop asking your team what they did last week"** (47 chars) — pain-point driven

**Recommendation**: Option 1. It's the clearest and most compelling.

### Gallery Images (5 images)

Plan these with a designer or use clean screenshots with annotations:

1. **Hero image**: The team dashboard showing summary stats (PRs merged, open, stuck, velocity) with the AI summary text visible. Clean, real data. Caption: "Your team's week at a glance"
2. **Needs Attention view**: The "Needs Attention" section showing stuck/blocked PRs with days stale. Caption: "Catch stuck PRs before they become blockers"
3. **Member breakdown**: Expanded member cards showing per-developer summaries (what they shipped, what's in flight). Caption: "Per-developer weekly summaries, zero effort"
4. **Setup flow**: The onboarding wizard — team name, paste GitHub token, done. Caption: "Setup in 60 seconds. One admin connects, everyone benefits"
5. **Email report**: The Monday morning email showing the weekly summary. Caption: "Your Monday morning starts with clarity, not a status meeting"

### The PH Description (for the product page)

See `docs/product-hunt-copy.md` for the full draft.

### Maker's First Comment

See `docs/product-hunt-copy.md` for the full draft. This is the most important piece of copy on launch day — post it within 60 seconds of launching.

### Technical Prep

- [ ] Make sure the app is stable. No deploys on launch day unless critical
- [ ] Set up a demo team with realistic data so PH visitors can see a real report
- [ ] Create a "PH Launch" landing page variant or banner ("Featured on Product Hunt" ribbon)
- [ ] Prepare a special offer for PH visitors: extended free trial or early-adopter pricing
- [ ] Test the signup flow end-to-end: sign up, create team, connect GitHub, generate first report
- [ ] Have someone outside the team go through the flow and give feedback

---

## 1 Week Before Launch: Final Prep

- [ ] Schedule the launch in PH (you can schedule it up to a week in advance)
- [ ] Best day: **Tuesday or Wednesday** (highest traffic, less competition than Monday)
- [ ] Launch time: **12:01 AM Pacific Time** to maximize the full 24-hour voting window
- [ ] Confirm all gallery images are uploaded and look good on mobile
- [ ] Draft all social posts (see `docs/product-hunt-copy.md`)
- [ ] Pre-write responses to common questions:
  - "How is this different from GitHub's built-in insights?" — "GitHub shows charts. We give you a narrative summary a human would write, plus it flags what needs attention. It's the report your manager would write if they had time to read every PR."
  - "Do you store our code?" — "No. We only read PR metadata (titles, descriptions, review status). We never access source code."
  - "What about Jira/Linear?" — "Coming in our next phase. We're starting with GitHub because that's where the real work happens."
  - "Why not just use Slack standup bots?" — "Slack bots ask people to type updates. We generate the updates automatically from the work that already happened. Zero effort from the team."
  - "Is there a free tier?" — "Free for teams up to 5 people. Pro is $10/seat/month for unlimited."
- [ ] Line up 5-10 friends/supporters who will upvote and leave genuine comments in the first 2 hours
  - **Important**: They should leave real comments, not just upvotes. PH's algorithm weighs comments heavily.
  - Ask them to describe their actual use case: "I manage a team of 6 and we waste 30 min every Monday on status updates"
- [ ] Email your Coming Soon list: "We're launching on Product Hunt next [day]. Here's how you can support us."
